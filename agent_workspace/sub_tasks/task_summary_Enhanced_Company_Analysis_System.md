# Enhanced_Company_Analysis_System

I have successfully enhanced the company analysis system with real-time web search capabilities. The system now automatically gathers comprehensive information about companies, including their official websites, headquarters, LinkedIn pages, parent companies, funding stages, and key products and services. It also identifies top competitors and populates a market comparison table. The enhanced system is integrated into the existing web application structure and includes robust error handling to manage cases where information is not readily available. The updated `company_analyzer.py` file and the research plan are provided as key deliverables.

## Key Files

- code/company_analyzer.py: The enhanced company analysis system with real-time search capabilities.
- docs/research_plan_company_analysis.md: The research plan for the enhanced company analysis system.

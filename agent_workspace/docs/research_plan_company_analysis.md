  - Sub-task 1.2: Implement a robust search query generation mechanism.
- **Phase 2: Deep Analysis**
  - Sub-task 2.1: Develop logic to identify parent companies and subsidiaries.
  - Sub-task 2.2: Analyze corporate structures and ownership.
- **Phase 3: Market Intelligence**
  - Sub-task 3.1: Extract and analyze product/service information.
  - Sub-task 3.2: Systematically identify and analyze key competitors.
- **Phase 4: Finalization**
  - Sub-task 4.1: Ensure all data is correctly formatted for the existing UI.
  - Sub-task 4.2: Implement comprehensive error handling and fallbacks.

## Key Questions
1. What are the most reliable methods for identifying a company's official website and headquarters?
2. How can we accurately determine a company's parent or holding group?
3. What are the best sources for detailed market analysis and competitor identification?
4. How can the system be designed to gracefully handle missing or incomplete information?

## Resource Strategy
- Primary data sources: Web search APIs, financial databases (if available), and official company websites.
- Search strategies: Utilize targeted keywords for specific information (e.g., "company name official website," "company name headquarters").

## Verification Plan
- Source requirements: Cross-reference information from at least two independent sources.
- Cross-validation: Compare data from web searches with information from any available structured data sources.

## Expected Deliverables
- An enhanced `company_analyzer.py` file with full real-time search and analysis capabilities.
- Supporting files or modules required for the new functionality.
- A final report detailing the enhancements and their integration.

## Workflow Selection
- Primary focus: Search
- Justification: The core of the task is to replace placeholder data with information gathered from real-time searches. This requires a strong focus on effective search strategies and data extraction.
